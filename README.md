SpeedsterÂ is my first solo coding project, a creation over two weeks during my freshman year winter break (December 2022). I wanted to expand upon my knowledge gained from COP3502C Programming Fundamentals I, whilst challenging myself to add in a new element: animation. I successfully programmed a total of twelve screens in the language Python using the import Pygame.

# Logistics
This game includes three game screens with a specified number of boxes: 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4. In the program, each box is set equal to a number. A randomized number generator then creates a preset list, which is checked against the user's own list (i.e. the user's box selections), each time a specified box flashes white and the user selects a box. The ultimate goal of the game is to identify the correct box that flashes white. The difficulty increases after every level, as the flashes become shorter and shorter.

# Gameflow
To improve gameflow, I developed several feedback features within the program. First and foremost, I created a function that detects the box the user clicks on, which then flashes black and returns to its original color, in an effort to identify to the player which box they selected. In addition to the three game screens, the program includes five gameover screens, three win screens, and one rules screen.
